NAME
    DBIx::Class::DeleteAction - Define delete triggers

SYNOPSIS
     package Your::Schema::Class;
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     
 use base 'DBIx::Class';
     
 __PACKAGE__->load_components(
       "DeleteAction",
       "PK",
       "Core",
     );
     
 __PACKAGE__->table("actor");
     __PACKAGE__->add_columns(qw/name/);
     
 __PACKAGE__->has_many(
        'actorroles' => 'MyDB::Schema::ActorRole',
        'actor',
        { 'foreign.actor' => 'self.id' },
        { delete_action => 'null' }
     );

DESCRIPTION
    With this DBIx::Class component you can specify actions that should be
    triggered on a row delete. A delete action is specified by adding the
    'delete_acction' key to the optional attribute HASH reference when
    specifing a new relation (see DBIx::Class::Relationship).

    The following hash values are supported:

    *   null

        Set all columns in related rows pointing to this record to NULL.

    *   delete

        Delete all related records.

    *   deny

        Deny deletion if this record is being referenced from other rows.

    *   CODE reference

        Execute custom code on delete. The current "DBIx::Class::Row" object
        and the name of the relation are passed to the code reference.

    *   STRING

        Execute a method with the given name. The method will be called on
        the current "DBIx::Class::Row" object and will get the name of the
        relation.

CAVEATS
    Note that the "delete" method in "DBIx::Class::ResultSet" will not run
    DeleteAction triggers. See "delete_all" if you need triggers to run.

    Any database-level cascade, restrict or trigger will take precedence
    over a DBIx-Class-DeleteAction based trigger.
